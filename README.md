## Future Scope

- **Own LLM (Large Language Model)**: Implementing a custom-trained model for more personalized and accurate summaries.
- **Download Summary Feature**: A feature that will allow users to download the summarized text as a file.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **AI**: Gemini(1.5) API

## Getting Started with the App

1. **Upload File**: Upload a file (e.g., text, PDF, etc.) to be summarized.
2. **Get Summary**: The app sends the file to the Flask backend, where it uses AI to generate a summary.
3. **Download Summary**: You will be able to download the summarized text as a file in the future.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for more file types.
- Improve the summary generation with more advanced AI models.
